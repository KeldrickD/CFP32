# 🏆 CFP32 – A 32-Team College Football Playoff Reimagined

### *Interactive Bracket • Bowl Integration • Season Model • Revenue Framework*

CFP32 is a fully interactive visualization and conceptual model that reimagines the College Football Playoff as a **32-team national tournament** — built on top of the existing bowl system and optimized for fairness, excitement, athlete compensation, and modern media economics.

This project includes:

* A **32-team seeded playoff bracket**
* Integrated **bowl game assignments**
* A redesigned **season timeline** (12 regular season games, 17 max total)
* Objective **ranking and seeding metrics**
* **Governance framework** and rule structure
* Detailed **revenue model & economic impact analysis**
* **Player welfare & NIL compensation** framework
* A complete **public-facing website** explaining the entire system

This app serves as both a **visual aid** and a **proposal** for the most scalable, equitable, and commercially powerful postseason in college football history.

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

College football has:

* The *biggest rosters*,
* The *most passionate fans*,
* The *largest stadiums*, and
* The *strongest regional identities*…

…and yet the smallest, most subjective playoff in major American sports.

**CFP32 fixes that.**

By expanding to 32 teams, embedding bowls, and aligning incentives for players, schools, conferences, and broadcasters, we create:

* A tournament worthy of the sport’s passion
* A structure built for NIL + modern media
* A postseason that dominates December and January
